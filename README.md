## PROMPTS IN AMAZON Q
You are an expert in Shaders, webGL and ThreeJS.
Create a minimal HTML file for a WebGL-based demo using Three.js. The canvas must fill the entire browser window with no scrollbars and load a JavaScript module named main.js.
In main.js, do the following:
### Scene 1: Psychedelic Intro
- Create a full-screen plane using a custom ShaderMaterial.
- Pass u_time and u_resolution as uniforms to both vertex and fragment shaders.
- Animate the scene using requestAnimationFrame.
- Write a basic vertex shader that directly passes the vertex position to gl_Position.
- Write a fragment shader that displays a colorful, animated, psychedelic effect using sine and cosine waves. Colors should change over time to evoke a retro 90s visual style.
- Overlay a CRT-style distortion effect: simulate scanlines, screen curvature, and RGB channel offsets to mimic an old monitor.
- Add a scrolling text banner like the Star Wars intro (from bottom to top), using either HTML/CSS or a Three.js text mesh.
- Load and autoplay a looping background track (assets/music1.mp3). Handle browser autoplay restrictions and add a button to mute/unmute the music.

### Scenes 2 to 6: Interactive Fractal Visuals
For each of the following five full-screen WebGL scenes, use a new fragment shader and its own background music:
- Scene 2: Julia Set â€” load music2.mp3
- Scene 3: Sierpinski Triangle â€” load music3.mp3
- Scene 4: Mandelbrot Set â€” load music4.mp3
- Scene 5: Newton-Raphson Set â€” load music5.mp3
- Scene 6: Menger Sponge â€” load music6.mp3

For all fractal scenes:
- Use ShaderMaterial with full-screen fragment shaders.
- Use u_time, u_resolution, and u_mouse as uniforms.
- Update fractal constants dynamically based on mouse movement.
- Each scene should render and update in real time.

### Navigation
- Create a button on the main page to switch between all six scenes.
- When a scene loads, the corresponding music file should also load and autoplay.
- For each scene containing a fractal, implement real-time dynamic interaction based on mouse movement. The mouse position should modify the constants used in the fractalâ€™s equation. Each shader must include u_time and u_resolution uniforms, and the fractal should be rendered in real time. Create a navigation button on the main page that links to each individual fractal scene. Additionally, load and play the corresponding .mp3 audio file for each scene when it loads.
- In all scenes that display fractals, add a fixed text element centered on the screen. This text should show the mathematical formula of the corresponding fractal. Ensure the text has a legible color with sufficient contrast against the background. Additionally, implement a subtle flowing animation (e.g., shimmer or gentle wave) triggered when the user hovers the mouse over the text.
